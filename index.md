## About Me
My research interests are related to large language models (LLMs) and their embedding spaces. Together with computational linguists and NLP researchers, I have worked on different projects that explored which linguistic properties and biases get encoded in contextual word embeddings. My focus lies on designing visual analytics approaches that support the interactive investigation of patterns in these high-dimensional vectors.
